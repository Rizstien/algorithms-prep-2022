# Next Greater Number BST
Given a BST node, return the node which has value just greater than the given node.

**Example:**

Given the tree

```
               100
              /   \
            98    102
           /  \
         96    99
          \
           97

```

Given `97`, you should return the node corresponding to `98` as thats the value just greater than `97` in the tree.  
If there are no successor in the tree ( the value is the largest in the tree, return `NULL`).

**Using recursion is not allowed.**

Assume that the value is always present in the tree.
