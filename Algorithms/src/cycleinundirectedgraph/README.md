# Cycle in Undirected Graph
**Problem Description**  

Given an undirected graph having **A** nodes labelled from **1** to **A** with **M** edges given in a form of matrix **B** of size `M x 2` where (B[i][0], B[i][1]) represents two nodes B[i][0] and B[i][1] connected by an edge.

Find whether the graph contains a cycle or not, return **1** if cycle is present else return **0**.

**NOTE:**

-   The cycle must contain atleast three nodes.
-   There are no self-loops in the graph.
-   There are no multiple edges between two nodes.
-   The graph may or may not be connected.
-   Nodes are numbered from 1 to A.
-   Your solution will run on multiple test cases. If you are using global variables make sure to clear them.

  
  
**Problem Constraints**  

1 <= A, M <= 3*10^5

1 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] <= A

_Input Format_

The first argument given is an integer **A** representing the number of nodes in the graph.

The second argument given is an matrix **B** of size `M x 2` which represents the **M** edges such that there is a edge between node **B[i][0]** and node **B[i][1]**.

  
  
_Output Format_

Return **1** if cycle is present else return **0**.

  
  
_Example Input_

Input 1:

 A = 5
 B = [[1. 2]
	        [1, 3]
	        [2, 3]
	        [1, 4]
	        [4, 5]
     ]

Input 2:

 A = 3
 B = [  [1. 2]
        [1, 3]
     ]

  
  
_Example Output_

Output 1:

 1

Output 2:

 0

  
  
_Example Explanation_*  

Explanation 1:

 There is a cycle in the graph i.e 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 so we will return 1

Explanation 2:

 No cycle present in the graph so we will return 0.
