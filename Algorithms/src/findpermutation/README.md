# Find Permutation
Given a positive integer `n` and a string `s` consisting only of letters _D_ or _I_, you have to find any permutation of first `n` positive integer that satisfy the given input string.

_D_ means the next number is smaller, while _I_ means the next number is greater.

**Notes**

-   Length of given string `s` will always equal to `n - 1`
-   Your solution should run in linear time and space.

**Example :**

```
Input 1:

n = 3

s = ID

Return: [1, 3, 2]


```
