# 4 Sum

Given an array `S` of `n` integers, are there elements `a, b, c, and d` in `S` such that `a + b + c + d = target`? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

> **Note:**
> 
> -   Elements in a quadruplet (a,b,c,d) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d)
> -   The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

**Example :**  
Given array `S = {1 0 -1 0 -2 2}`, and `target = 0`  
A solution set is:

```
    (-2, -1, 1, 2)
    (-2,  0, 0, 2)
    (-1,  0, 0, 1)

```

Also make sure that the solution set is lexicographically sorted.  
`Solution[i] < Solution[j] iff Solution[i][0] < Solution[j][0] OR (Solution[i][0] == Solution[j][0] AND ... Solution[i][k] < Solution[j][k])`
